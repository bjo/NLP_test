Tesla Motors was one of the market movers last week, with the stock touching a low of $123.93 on Monday, Dec. 2, only to close the week about 11% higher on Friday at $137. Last Tuesday was a particularly busy day for shares of Tesla, as the stock climbed on unusually high volume of 25,625,400. Let's take a closer look at what caused the move last week, and what investors can anticipate in the week ahead.

Last week's defining "Tesla" moments

More than 25 million Tesla shares traded hands last Tuesday, pushing the stock higher by 17% that day. Good news from German investigators, as well as an analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley, was to thank. First, a German probe into recent Tesla Model S fires found "no manufacturer-related defects." While a U.S. investigation by the NHTSA is still under way, the seal of approval from the German Federal Motor Transport Authority was nonetheless encouraging.

On top of this, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reiterated his support for the stock by naming Tesla his top pick among stocks within the auto sector. Commenting on the Model S fire incidents, Jonas said his firm is "impressed there have only been three fires since the car has gone on sale over 17 months, 22,000 units and some 130 million miles driven ago." As a result, Morgan Stanley now has a price target of $153 on shares of Tesla.

Tesla gained even more attention later in the week, after SolarCity announced a new solar-powered storage system that uses Tesla's lithium-ion batteries. This is a perfect fit for the electric-car maker, particularly because Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, is already a majority shareholder in SolarCity. It also helps that Musk is cousins with SolarCity's CEO Lyndon Rive.
