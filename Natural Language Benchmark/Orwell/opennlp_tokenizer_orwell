In Moulmein , in lower Burma , I was hated by large numbers of people â€“ the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me .
I was sub - divisional police officer of the town , and in an aimless , petty kind of way anti - European feeling was very bitter .
No one had the guts to raise a riot , but if a European woman went through the bazaars alone somebody would probably spit betel juice over her dress .
As a police officer I was an obvious target and was baited whenever it seemed safe to do so .
When a nimble Burman tripped me up on the football field and the referee ( another Burman ) looked the other way , the crowd yelled with hideous laughter .
This happened more than once .
In the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere , the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance , got badly on my nerves .
The young Buddhist priests were the worst of all .
There were several thousands of them in the town and none of them seemed to have anything to do except stand on street corners and jeer at Europeans .
